  short_intro: I am a Data Scientist (GenAI | LLM | Agent) at Datategy (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·), where I contribute to the development of the papAI-GenAI product. In this role, I am also actively engaged in computer vision projects, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and 2D-3D Pose Estimation. <br/>
               This comes after recently obtaining a Ph.D in Applied Mathematics-GenAI and Industrial Engineering from Ã‰cole Nationale SupÃ©rieure des Mines de Saint-Ã‰tienne 
               (Department of Mathematics and Industrial Engineering, <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/recherche/centres-et-departements/departement-genie-mathematique-et-industriel/" target="_blank">Institute Henri Fayol</a>),
               working on <i>Artificial Intelligence for Failure Analysis in Semiconductor Industry 4.0<i/>. An industrial collaboration with 
                <a href="https://www.st.com/" target="_blank">STMicroelectronics</a>, <a href="https://www.bosch.com/" target="_blank">Bosch</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.infineon.com/" target="_blank">Infineon AG</a> under the <a href="https://penta-eureka.eu/project-overview/penta-call-4/fa4-0/" target="_blank">FA4.0 EURIPIDES<sup>2</sup>-PENTA</a> project.<br/>
                My Ph.D research focused on improving Generative Artificial intelligence via Probabilistic Graphical Modeling with Causal Large Language Models (LLMs), for decision-making during Failure Root Cause Analysis (FRCA). Advised by <a href="https://limos.fr/detailperson/10" target="_blank">Professor Mireille Batton-Hubert</a>,                 <a href="https://www.emse.fr/~boucher/" target="_blank">Professor Xavier Boucher</a> (both from EMSE) and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/pascal-gounet-6a6b521" target="_blank">Pascal Gounet</a> and Jerome Adrian (both Physical Failure Analyst Engineers, 
                <a href="https://www.st.com/" target="_blank">STMicroelectronics</a>). I obtained a dual M.S. degree in <a href="https://mldm.univ-st-etienne.fr/" target="_blank">Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM)-Computer science</a> from UniversitÃ© Jean Monnet and a B.S. degree in
                <a href="http://www.velsuniv.ac.in/school-computing-sciences.asp" target="_blank">Computer Application</a> at Vels University, Chennai, India. My experiences ranges from applied ML (ML from scratch), data analysis to python development working with 
                <a href="https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.fr/" target="_blank">IFP Energies nouvelles</a>,
                <a href="https://www.woelfel.de/" target="_blank">WÃ¶lfel Engineering GmBH</a> and 
                <a href="http://www.velsuniv.ac.in/school-computing-sciences.asp" target="_blank">VISTAS</a>, as well as supervising a <a href="https://fecn.unilurio.ac.mz/en/ai-coralreef/" target="_blank">UNESCO AI project</a>. <br/>
                In addition to my current role at Datategy, I serve as a visiting lecturer at both Ã‰cole des Mines, Saint-Ã‰tienne, where I deliver lectures on Big Data, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to third-year engineering and Master's in Mathematics students and UniversitÃ© Ã‰vry Paris-Saclay, where I deliver lectures on Data Science to Masters students.
